### Model Train Detection And Action - NEW Arduino library

Work in progress

MTD2A is a collection of user friendly advanced and functional C++ classes - building blocks - for time-controlled handling of input and output. The library is intended for Arduino enthusiasts without much programming experience, who are interested in electronics control and automation, and model trains as a hobby.

### Common to all building blocks are:
• They support a wide range of input sensors and output devices <br/>
• Are simple to use to build complex solutions with few commands <br/>
• They operate non-blocking, process-oriented and state-driven <br/>
• Support parallel processing and asynchronous execution <br/>
• Offers extensive control and troubleshooting information <br/>
• Thoroughly documented with examples <br>

### Example of parallel processing

# Installation for Arduino IDE
Download the entire MTD2A repository as a ZIP file.

![](/image/MTD2A-download.png)

Unzip the ZIP file and rename the directory name to MTD2A. <br/>
Move everything to the Arduino home directory under libraries: **Arduino/libraries/MTD2A** <br/>
The examples can now be selected from the list of examples in the Arduino IDE **Examples** <br/>
